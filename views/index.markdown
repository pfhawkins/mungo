## What Does This Do?

Mungo munges URLS and gives you strings. 

## Number then String

If you pass mungo a number, *x*, then a string, mungo will multiply that string *x*
times.

Example:

<pre>http://mungo.hyperverses.com/23/hawk</pre>

Returns:

<pre>hawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawk</pre>

## ascii characters

If you pass mungo "all", mungo will give you characters 1-255 worth of ascii.

## Command-line Friendly

No fancy HTML is returned, so e.g. curling a mungo URL will give you usable results
in the terminal.
