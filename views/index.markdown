## What Does This Do?

Mungo munges URLS and gives you strings. 

### Number then String

If you pass mungo a number, *x*, then a string, mungo will multiply that string *x*
times.

Example:

<pre>http://mungo.hyperverses.com/23/hawk</pre>

Returns:

<pre>hawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawkhawk</pre>

### ascii characters

If you pass mungo "all", mungo will give you characters 1-255 worth of ascii.
